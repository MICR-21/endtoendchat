## Project Overview

This application simulates secure message communication using end-to-end encryption. Each user generates and exchanges ElGamal key pairs, and messages are encrypted and decrypted with Diffie-Hellman (DH) ratcheting. The system supports out-of-order message handling and includes a basic implementation for government surveillance.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using the Double Ratchet algorithm, ensuring strong security.
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Uses certificates to verify the authenticity of user keys.
- **Out-of-Order Message Handling**: Can handle out-of-sequence messages and securely reassemble them.
- **Government Surveillance Compatibility**: Includes a mechanism for decrypting messages if authorized.
